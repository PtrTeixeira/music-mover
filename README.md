While I was restoring some files, I accidentally destroyed the folder
structure of the mp3 files I had downloaded from iTunes, so I had a
bunch of mp3 files with complete metadata all in a single folder. I
needed to transform that back into an appropriate directory hieararchy
(specifically `<artist>/<album>/<file>`) to satisfy the music server
that I was using (Jellyfin). 

I've actually run this and finished that migration, so this tool is
essentially finished for me. I'm probably going to clean up the code
here a little bit to figure out how I want (neo)vim to work as a Rust
IDE for me, but after that I'll probably archive this.
